Marking Year 0 NA (Nova Aurora), humanity awakens on Scopus IV, ready to begin anew — but not without mystery. Two of <em>The Long Night</em>&#39;s six segments are missing, their fate unknown. Amid the first breath of settlement, the First City rises, surrounding a Tower that houses the last 500 Guardians, the elite protectors gifted with powers tied to the Traveler, now reduced to mere memories embedded in the city’s heart.</p><p>By Year 25 NA, all remaining survivors are revived, forming a fragile but determined society of 300,000. <em>The Long Night</em> itself transforms into a bustling orbital station, overseeing scouting efforts that chart the surrounding planetary system. The next century is dedicated to taming this new planet to humanity’s will. A few brave souls venture out to establish mining colonies in the outer parts of the system.</p><p>In the year 202, alien vessels raid outer settlements, revealing the enigmatic Eliksni — also called The Fallen — a fragmented race with tangled history and grudges. This revelation sparks the birth of the Enclave Navy, as humanity braces itself for new threats. Hostilities flare until a fragile non-aggression pact is struck with a few selected Fallen Houses. Over the following decades, humanity expands steadily, founding colonies outside of the Scopus system, such as Junyo, Minerva, and Moebius.</p><p>By Year 250 NA, the population soars: 35 million humans, 400,000 Awoken, and 3 million Exos. Diplomacy flourishes with the first contact with the Triumvirate, a federation of three alien species, introducing trade, science, and mutual protection agreements. A new golden age dawns. Humanity thrives despite the absence of the Traveler’s power, with Guardians upholding a tenuous peace. Over centuries, the Traveler becomes myth — a cosmic ghost whose presence shaped everything, yet whose disappearance redefined human resilience.</p><p>Then, in Year 411 NA, a chilling echo from the past pierces the silence — a distress signal from ancient human technology. One of the long-lost segments of <em>The Long Night</em>. An expedition is prepared, while unknown perpetrators cause unrest all around the Enclave, the Triumvirate closes its borders after human ships allegedly attacked convoys, and the Fallen are in a new civil war, with the Houses fighting for supremacy yet again. The era of expansion grinds to a halt. Tensions stir, alliances tighten and strain. The Enclave mobilizes. Secrets from centuries ago claw their way back into the light. What happened to the lost segments? Who — or what — sent the signal? And who does not want Humanity to reach them?</p>',6)])])}const p=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,p as default};
