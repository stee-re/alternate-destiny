From nimble star-fighters—swift and agile craft ideal for dogfights and reconnaissance—over corvettes and frigates serving as patrol ships, balancing speed with firepower, to cruisers and destroyers, which bring heavier armaments and armor and often form the backbone of a fleet. At the pinnacle of power are battleships and carriers: massive vessels capable of deploying squadrons, absorbing punishment, and commanding entire battle groups.</p><p>Beyond the warships and battle-cruisers that dominate the void, a quieter but no less vital fleet traverses the stars: civilian ships. These transports and freighters haul essential cargo—food, fuel, and trade goods—across vast interstellar routes, forming the economic backbone of the galaxy. Though weakly armed and often overlooked, these ships are the lifeblood of civilization, keeping distant systems connected and thriving.</p><h2 id="measuring-the-void" tabindex="-1">Measuring the Void <a class="header-anchor" href="#measuring-the-void" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Measuring the Void&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The silhouette system is used to represent the relative size and mass of vehicles and star-ships, influencing combat, detection, and maneuverability.
