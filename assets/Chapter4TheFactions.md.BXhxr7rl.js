After the Collapse—an apocalyptic event not much is known about—tore through their society, what remained fractured into rival Houses and clans, each clinging to fragments of identity, technology, and purpose. Though some of their houses fight about succession and power, others crave restoration or rebirth. From the marauding House of Wolves to the reclusive mystics of House of Rain, these factions represent a spectrum of survival strategies—some steeped in tradition, others transformed by pragmatism. Their relationship with humanity is equally fractured: wary, opportunistic, hostile, or hopeful, depending on which banner they fly and how deep their scars run.</p><h2 id="house-of-wolves" tabindex="-1">House of Wolves <a class="header-anchor" href="#house-of-wolves" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;House of Wolves&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Once feared across the Eliskni empire, the House of Wolves is the embodiment of the Fallen’s ruthless survival instincts. With shattered traditions and a fractured command, this house evolved into a nomadic band of marauders, scavenging from derelict space hulks and launching hit-and-run raids on supply convoys. Their loyalty is earned only through strength and spoils. The Wolves operate like a loose confederacy of pirate crews, each led by a ruthless Baron who seeks to carve out their own domain among the stars. Though they lack centralized leadership, their unpredictability makes them formidable enemies.</p>',5)])])}const m=a(r,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
