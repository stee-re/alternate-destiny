# Chapter 8: Of Might and Magic

Magic in the Genesys system is designed to be narrative-first and highly flexible, empowering players to craft spell effects that suit the story rather than bind them to rigid lists. Instead of predefined spells, casters build their magical actions using a selection of core Magic Actions, customized with additional effects and governed by skill checks and narrative consequences.

### Is he casting a spell?

To cast a spell:

1. Select a Magic Action (e.g., Attack, Barrier, Curse, ...)
2. Modify with Additional Effects based on the caster’s intentions (e.g., Area, Range, Duration, ...)
3. Determine the base Difficulty of the spell, increase the difficulty based on the number and nature of added effects
4. Spend 2 Strain
5. Roll using the appropriate magic skill, applying results as per normal skill checks

Magic checks are subject to strain costs, reflecting the effort of conjuring supernatural power. Each spell costs 2 Strain to cast. Concentration enables specific spells to be maintained for longer than what their base allows. Concentrating on one spell requires one Maneuver per turn.

### Spells

Spells consist of a base effect and additional effects. Base effects are the minimum planned outcome a Spell can have. Additional effects can be learned by spending XP and provide additional effects or completely changing the base effect by increasing the difficulty.
