# Chapter 6: Of weird dice and no numbers

This document is for quickly conveying the core concepts of the Narrative Dice System to players. Bringing players in from other role-playing games can be difficult because people love to stick with what they know best. If you are a player reading this, then someone you know wants to run a Genesys game for you. This person thinks that you will have a lot of fun trying this system. Genesys gives us ways to tell our stories we have not had before. It is a multi-axis dice mechanic, letting characters succeed at a cost or fail but still attain something positive. It also allows for epic triumphs and story-bending despair. Anything new can be scary or intimidating, or maybe cause one to just feel a little bit wary. But hopefully you trust that the person giving this document to you is capable of telling a fun and engaging story regardless of the system, so just give it a shot. Finally, this quick start guide does not constitute all the rules needed for play. Your GM should hopefully have a good grasp of them already. This is intended solely to on-board new players quickly and show the minimum necessary concepts to get started.

## Weird Dice

Where are the numbers? We don’t need numbers. We don’t compare results to a series of tables or try to do arithmetic in the middle of a combat encounter. These new dice show us the story beyond simple binary success or failure. There are three of each type and are separated into positive and negative dice. Positive dice represent your character’s raw ability, their skill training, and other boons from circumstance or the environment. Negative dice represent the inherent obstacles, opponent’s training, or hindrances from circumstances or the environment.

### The nice dice

The three types of positive dice are Ability, Proficiency, and Boost. Having more of any of them when rolling is always good. These are then counteracted by the mean dice next to them.

#### Ability

The green Ability die represents basic skill or aptitude and forms the base of any skill check.

#### Proficiency

The yellow Proficiency die represents advanced skill or training. The only way to use a Proficiency die is if an Ability die gets upgraded.

#### Boost

The blue Boost die represents additional benefits from lucky circumstances, careful planning, and help from friends.

### The mean dice

The three types of negative dice are Difficulty, Challenge, and Setback. You want to mitigate how many of these dice you have to roll. Although, it is through these dice that the most interesting complications can occur.

#### Difficulty

The purple Difficulty die represents basic obstacles and the inherent difficulty of performing a task.

#### Challenge

The red Challenge die represents more extreme adversity or advanced training of a foe. To get a Challenge die in your dice pool a Difficulty die must be upgraded.

#### Setback

The black Setback die represents hindrances from unlucky circumstances, environmental hazards, or a foe actively working against you.
