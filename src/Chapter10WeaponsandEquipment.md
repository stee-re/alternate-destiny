# Chapter 10: Weapons and Equipment

## Item Qualities

### Accurate

Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield, whether through design or technology. For each level of this quality, the attacker adds to their combat checks while using this weapon.

### Auto-Fire

A weapon with Auto-fire can be set to shoot in rapid succession and potentially spray an area with projectiles. The advantage in using Auto-fire is that it has the chance to hit multiple targets or to hit a single target multiple times. As attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally less accurate, the attacker must increase the difficulty of the combat check by . The user may choose not to use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case, they cannot trigger the quality but also do not suffer the aforementioned penalty. If the attack hits, the attacker can trigger Auto-fire by spending . Auto-fire can be triggered multiple times. Each time the attacker triggers Auto-fire, it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that weapon, and each hit deals base damage plus the number of s on the check. These additional hits can be allocated to the original target, or to other targets in proximity of the target. If the attacker wishes to hit multiple targets, they must decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore, if they wish to hit multiple targets, their initial target must always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if this is two separate targets, the GM chooses which is the initial target). The initial hit must always be against the initial target. Subsequent hits generated can be allocated to any of the other designated targets.

### Blast

The weapon has a spread, an explosive blast, or a similar area of effect, like a detonated grenade or a warhead fired from a missile launcher. If the attack is successful and Blast activates, each character (friend or foe) in engaged range with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast quality’s rating, plus damage equal to the total s scored on the check. If the Blast quality doesn’t activate, the ordnance still detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the firer (or quick reactions on the part of the targets) means the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius. However, the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses by spending . In this case, the original target and every target engaged with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast rating of the weapon.

### Blast (Large)

Identical to Blast, but covers characters in short range instead of only engaged ones.

### Breach

Weapons with Breach burn through the toughest armor; they are often heavy weapons or weapons mounted on some sort of vehicle. Hits from weapons with the Breach quality ignore one point of vehicle armor for every rating of Breach (meaning they also ignore 10 soak for every rating of Breach).

### Buff

Increase the wearer's Wound threshold by the Buff rating while wearing the item. The wounds provided by Buff are used before the wearer’s wounds, thus taking off an item with the Buff quality cannot cause a critical hit.

### Burn

Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. When Burn is triggered, one target hit by the attack continues to suffer the weapon’s base damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Burn rating. Apply damage at the start of each of the target’s turns. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Burn, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time. A victim might be able to stop the damage by performing an action to roll around and make a Coordination check. The difficulty is Average (
